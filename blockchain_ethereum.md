# Blockchain Ethereum 

## Blockchain definition

A blockchain is a database of transactions that is updated and shared across many computers in a network. 
Every time a new set of transactions is added, its called a “block” - hence the name blockchain. 
Public blockchains like Ethereum allow anyone to add, but not remove, data. 
If someone wanted to alter any of the information or cheat the system, they’d need to do so on the majority of computers on the network. 
That is a lot! This makes decentralized blockchains like Ethereum highly secure.

## Nodes and Network

A **node** is any instance of Ethereum client software that is connected to other computers also running Ethereum software, forming a network.

## Transaction

There are three common types of transactions on the Ethereum network:

- An ordinary transaction, when there is a transfer of ETH/ether from one account to another.
- A transaction creating a contract is the type of transaction where a smart-contract in deployed on the Ethereum blockchain network.
- A transaction invoking a contract, this transaction is sent with some data and is used to query/interact with a previously deployed smart-contract.
