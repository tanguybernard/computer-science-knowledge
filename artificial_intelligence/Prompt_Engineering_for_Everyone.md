## Module 1: Introduction to Prompt Engineering

### Zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot prompting

In a zero-shot scenario, the model is given a task without any prior examples; it must determine what to do based solely on the prompt and its training.

For example, when we asked, 'What is Prompt Engineering?' we used a zero-shot prompt.

In contrast, a one-shot prompt provides the model with a single example, while a few-shot prompt includes multiple examples to guide its output.

Naive or standard prompts typical don't use few-shots prompting.
