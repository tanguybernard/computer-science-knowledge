## Module 1: Introduction to Prompt Engineering

### Zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot prompting

In a zero-shot scenario, the model is given a task without any prior examples; it must determine what to do based solely on the prompt and its training.

For example, when we asked, 'What is Prompt Engineering?' we used a zero-shot prompt.

In contrast, a one-shot prompt provides the model with a single example, while a few-shot prompt includes multiple examples to guide its output.

Naive or standard prompts typical don't use few-shots prompting.

### Lab 3

#### The difference between prompt instructions and the prompt
Technically, you could paste in the Prompt Instructions just before your question for the AI. What is the difference between the two approaches?

Aside from appearing much neater visually, splitting the prompt instructions from the prompt allows us to lock the instructions to the whole conversation without repasting it each time we ask a question.

Occasionally, this differs from what we want, so placing such instructions directly in the prompt textbox can be beneficial to limit them to that single question without affecting the rest of the chat.
