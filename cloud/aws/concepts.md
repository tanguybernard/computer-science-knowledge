## Cloud Computing

Definition: On-demand delivery of IT resources and applications through the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing

3 Models:
- Cloud Based
- On-Premise
- Hybrid

__Upfront expense__ refers to data centers, physical servers, and other resources that you would need to invest in before using them.

__Variable expense__ means you only pay for computing resources you consume.


__How does the scale of cloud computing help you to save costs?__
The aggregated cloud usage from a large number of customers results in lower pay-as-you-go prices.


## AWS Well-Architected 

AWS Well-Architected  helps cloud architects and developers build secure, high-performing, resilient, and efficient infrastructure for a variety of applications and workloads.

## AWS Global Infrastructure

### Region, AZ, Edge Location

__A Region__ is a geographical isolated area that contains AWS resources.

An __Availability Zone__ (Logical Data center) is a single data center or a group of data centers within a Region. Availability Zones are located tens of miles apart from each other. 

A Region consists of three or more Availability Zones.

Each AZ have one or more physical data centers.

An __edge location__ is a site that Amazon CloudFront uses to store cached copies of your content closer to your customers for faster delivery.

Edge Location can run CloudFront (CDN) and Amazon Route 53 (DNS)


Example "Edge Location":

Suppose you have your website hosted in S3 and EC2 instances within a Region in the US with an associated configured CloudFront distribution.

A user from Europe who attempts to access your website will be redirected to a European Edge Location thatâ€™s nearest to them. From that Edge Location, the cache data will be read on your website, considerably reducing latency.


__AWS Outposts__ is a __service__ that you can use to run AWS infrastructure, services, and tools in your own __on-premises__ data center in a hybrid approach.

AWS 22 Regions (Separate Geographic area), and inside there are multiple Availability Zones (AZ), at least 2 per region. Each AZ is fully isolated.

Partition: A partition is a grouping of Regions. 


Choosin a region (reason):
- Compliance (with data governance and legal requirements)
- Proximity (to your customers)
- Feature availability (Available services within a Region)
- Pricing

### How to Provision AWS Resources

- The AWS Management Console is a web-based interface for accessing and managing AWS services.
- AWS CLI enables you to control multiple AWS services directly from the command line within one tool.
- SDKs make it easier for you to use AWS services through an API designed for your programming language or platform.


The AWS Management Console includes wizards (FR: des assistants) and workflows that you can use to complete tasks in AWS services.

  You can also use :

__AWS Elastic Beanstalk__

With AWS Elastic Beanstalk, you provide code and configuration settings, and Elastic Beanstalk deploys the resources necessary to perform the following tasks:

- Adjust capacity
- Load balancing
- Automatic scaling
- Application health monitoring

__AWS CloudFormation__

Infrastructure as code tool used to define a wide variety of AWS resources. Using json or yaml.

## AWS Migration strategy (approach)

A migration strategy is the approach used to migrate a workload into the AWS Cloud. There are seven migration strategies for moving applications to the cloud, known as the 7 Rs:

- Retire
- Retain
- Rehost
- Relocate
- Repurchase
- Replatform
- Refactor or re-architect

## AWS Services


### Amazon EC2 - Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud

Instance -> Virtual Server

There are different types of instance (ex: t2) and different size.

AMI : Amazon Machine Image = Information To Launch one or many instances.

AMI is composed of: OS, Applications and App Server

EC2 Storage Possibility:
- EBS (Persistant)
- EFS
- Instant Storre (Temporary)

How To Connect ?

- EC2 Instant Connect
- Session Manager (a capability of AWS Systems Manager)
- ssh client

Burstable:

Traditional Amazon EC2 instance types provide fixed CPU resources, while burstable performance instances provide a baseline level of CPU utilization with the ability to burst CPU utilization above the baseline level. 

Use :

If you want host traditional application and a full access to the OS, use EC2.


#### Family

- General Purpose: Balanced ressources - Ideal for Web Services, backend servers for enterprise applications...
- Compute optimized: high-performance processors - Ideal for Web, gaming servers...
- Memory optimized: fast performance for workloads that process large datasets in memory (ex: high-performance databases)
- Accelerated computing: use hardware accelerators, or coprocessors, to perform some functions more efficiently than is possible in software running on CPUs
- Storage optimized: high performance for locally stored data. (ex: data warehousing applications)

Notes :

Q: You want to use an Amazon EC2 instance for a batch processing workload. What would be the best Amazon EC2 instance type to use? 

A: Compute optimized

#### Amazon EC2 pricing

- On Demand
- Savings Plans
- Reserved Instances (predictable )
- Spot Instances (can be reclaim, can be interrupted)
- Dedicated hosts (physical servers with Amazon EC2 instance capacity that is fully dedicated to your use)

Notes:

EC2 Instance Savings Plans reduce your EC2 instance costs when you make an hourly spend commitment to an instance family and Region for a 1-year or 3-year term.

Reserved Instances require a commitment of either 1 year or 3 years. The 3-year option offers a larger discount.

__What is the difference between EC2 Savings Plan and Reserved Instances (RIs)?__

__Reserved instances__ provide a discount when you reserve a certain amount of __computing power__ (measured per hour) for a one- or three-year period while __Savings Plans__ provide a discount when you commit to spending a __certain amount__ (measured in dollars per hour) for a one-or three-year period.


### AWS EC2 Auto Scaling and Healing

#### Scaling

Two approaches:

- Dynamic scaling responds to changing demand. 
- Predictive scaling automatically schedules the right number of Amazon EC2 instances based on predicted demand.


##### Auto Scaling group

An Auto Scaling group contains a collection of EC2 instances that are treated as a logical grouping for the purposes of automatic scaling and management. 

You can set:
- minimum capacity (number of Amazon EC2 instances that launch immediately after you have created the Auto Scaling group)
- desired capacity
- maximum capacity

###### How Configure ?

You can capture the content of an instance and its volume into AMI :

1. Click to an Instance
2. Actions
3. Image and template
4. Create Image

By default, an AMI that you create is available only within the AWS Region of creation.


Create a Launch Template

For example, a launch template can contain the AMI ID, instance type (ex: t2.nano), and network settings that you typically use to launch instances.

Finally Create an Auto Scaling Group

You can create a __Scheduled scaling__ : 

With scheduled scaling, you can set up automatic scaling for your application based on predictable load changes by creating scheduled actions that increase or decrease your group's desired capacity at specific times.

#### Healing

For example with Load Balancer to Replace or Rebalance.

#### Customer Responsability of EC2:

- Provision instances (virtual servers).
- Upload your code.
- Continue to manage the instances while your application is running.

### AWS Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)

Service that automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple resources, such as Amazon EC2 instances.

### Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS)

Message queuing service. 

In Amazon SQS, an application sends messages into a queue.

### Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS)

Pub Sub service.

A web service that coordinates and manages message delivery from publishers to subscribers.

Using Amazon SNS topics, a publisher publishes messages to subscribers.

### AWS Lambda (Serverless Compute)

AWS Lambda is serverless compute service for running code without having to provision or manage servers.

AWS Lambda has a configurable maximum execution time limit of up to 15 minutes.


### AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS)

Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS)(opens in a new tab) is a highly scalable, high-performance container management system that enables you to run and scale containerized applications on AWS. 

### AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)

Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS)(opens in a new tab) is a fully managed service that you can use to run Kubernetes on AWS. 

### AWS Fargate

AWS Fargate(opens in a new tab) is a serverless compute engine for containers. It works with both Amazon ECS and Amazon EKS. 

### Notes: Compute choice

If you want host traditional application and a full access to the OS, use EC2.

If you want host short running function, service oriented applications or event driven applications with no provisioning and managing servers, you can use AWS Lambda.

If you run docker container, choose a tool, ECS or EKS. Next choose a plateform, EC2 that you manage or serverless env like AWS Fargate managed for you.

### AWS ECR



### AWS Systems Manager

AWS Systems Manager provides configuration management, which helps you maintain consistent configuration of your Amazon EC2 or on-premises instances. With Systems Manager, you can control configuration details such as server configurations, anti-virus definitions, firewall settings, and more.





### Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS)

Using multiple AZ's means : high availability and disaster recovery, not increased performance

Doing read-intensive workloads ? Solution : A read replica

### AWS CloudFormation

AWS CloudFormation is a service that helps you model and set up your AWS resources

### AWS CloudFront (CDN)

Amazon CloudFront is a web service that speeds up distribution of your static and dynamic web content, such as .html, .css, .js, and image files, to your users. CloudFront delivers your content through a worldwide network of data centers called edge locations. 

Note : 

__AWS Shield Standard__ is included automatically and transparently to Amazon CloudFront distributions providing:
- Active Traffic Monitoring with Network flow monitoring and Automatic always-on detection.
- Attack Mitigations with Protection from common DDoS attacks

Note :

__Edge locations__ are AWS data centers designed to deliver services with the lowest latency possible.

CloudFront, which uses edge locations to cache copies of the content that it serves, so the content is closer to users and can be delivered to them faster.

### AWS CloudTrail

AWS CloudTrail is an AWS service that helps you enable operational and risk auditing, governance, and compliance of your AWS account. Actions taken by a user, role, or an AWS service are recorded as events in CloudTrail. Events include actions taken in the AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface, and AWS SDKs and APIs.

### AWS CloudWatch

Monitoring and observability service.

Monitor resources. Track metrics CPU, RAM, Network...

Collect metrics on AWS Services and On-Premises


### AWS Elasctic Load Balancing (ELB)

Distributes incoming traffic.

To do that, we must create Listener, that define rules.

Load Balancer Types (for High Availability, Automatic Scaling, Robust Security, Fault Tolerance) :
- Application LB (Layer 7 - App, http, https, gRPC)
- Network LB (Layer 4 - Connetion, TCP, UDP, TLS)
- Gateway LB (Layer 4 And Layer 3 - Gateway, IP)
- Classic LB (Layer 4 - Layer 7, TCP, SSL, TLS, HTTP, HTTPS)

### AWS IAM

Manage access to AWS Resources

Free Service

## Pricing

## Networking

### Connectivity

#### AWS VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)

Control Virtual Network Environment (Ip Adress range, subnets, route tables, Network Gateways)

- Public ressources : Exposition to the Internet
- Private resources: No exposition to  the internet

Public or private grouping resources is a __subnet__.

A __subnet__ is a range of IP addresses in your VPC. You can create AWS resources, such as EC2 instances, in specific subnets.

A subnet is a section of a VPC that can contain resources such as Amazon EC2 instances.

For example:

A cashier can be a public subnet. Customers order their coffee from the cashier. And barista who prepare coffee can be in private subnet.

#### Internet Gateway

To allow public traffic from the internet to access your VPC, you attach an internet gateway to the VPC.

#### Virtual private gateway

A virtual private gateway enables you to establish a virtual private network (VPN) connection between your VPC and a private network, such as an on-premises data center or internal corporate network. A virtual private gateway allows traffic into the VPC only if it is coming from an approved network.

The virtual private gateway is the component that allows protected internet traffic to enter into the VPC. Even though your connection to the coffee shop has extra protection, traffic jams (embouteillages) are possible because youâ€™re using the same road as other customers. 

#### AWS Direct Connect

AWS Direct Connect is a service that lets you to establish a dedicated private connection between your data center and a VPC.  

#### Internet Gateway vs NAT Gateway


- Internet Gateway (IGW) allows instances with public IPs to access the internet.
- NAT Gateway (NGW) allows instances with no public IPs to access the internet.

#### VPC Peering

A VPC peering connection is a networking connection between two VPCs that enables you to route traffic between them using private IPv4 addresses or IPv6 addresses. 

VPC Peering supports peering between multiple accounts


##### Configuration

1. Add VPC Peering
2. VPC Peering > Actions > Accept Request
1. ec2 Instance (Requester)  > Subnet > Route table > Route > Edit Routes > Add route > Copy CIDR (Finance) from VPC on Destination (ex: 172.31.0.0/16) AND Peering Conection (pcx- ...)
2. ec2 Instance (Accepter) > Subnet > Route table > Route > Edit Routes > Add route > Copy CIDR (Marketing) from VPC on Destination (ex: 192.168.0.0/20) AND Peering Conection (pcx- ...)
1. ec2 Instance Finance (Accepter) > update security > ADD ICMP - IPv4 (Copy CIDR 192.168.0.0/20) 
2. ec2 Instance DeveloperInstance > Connect > Session Manager > "ping 172.31.1.163"



### Security

#### NACL 

Network Access Control List == Firewall at the subnet boundary

You can dispose of multiple subnets to a NACL but only one NACL per subnet

Subnet * -- 1 NACL

#### Security Group (Virtual Firewall at Instance Level)

By DEfault Denies all Inbound Traffic and Allows all Outbound Traffic

Security Group are Stateful


__Security group as Source for a rule in another Security Group:__

"When you specify a security group as the source for a rule, traffic is allowed from the network interfaces that are associated with the source security group for the specified protocol and port. Incoming traffic is allowed based on the private IP addresses of the network interfaces that are associated with the source security group (and not the public IP or Elastic IP addresses). Adding a security group as a source does not add rules from the source security group."


https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-security-groups.html#SecurityGroupRules


### Highly Available Web Application

- Minimize service interruptions
- Enable resources to be available when they are needed

Principles for architecting High Availability:

- Design For Failure (solution ex: Services spread over multiple regions and AZs)
- Embrace elasticity and Automation (solution ex: CloudWatch and Auto Scaling Groups)
- Loosely couple components (solution ex: Elastic Load Balancer, Amazon SQS (Queue))
- Become Stateless (Amazon Elasticache, DynamoDB)
- Use Parallelism (ex: Use microservices)
- Security as forethought (ex: Encryption, Principle Of Least Privileges)
