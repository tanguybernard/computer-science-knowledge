## AWS Pricing Concepts

### How AWS pricing works


#### Pay for what you use.

For each service, you pay for exactly the amount of resources that you actually use, without requiring long-term contracts or complex licensing. 

#### Pay less when you reserve.

Some services offer reservation options that provide a significant discount compared to On-Demand Instance pricing.

For example, suppose that your company is using Amazon EC2 instances for a workload that needs to run continuously. You might choose to run this workload on Amazon EC2 Instance Savings Plans, because the plan allows you to save up to 72% over the equivalent On-Demand Instance capacity.

#### Pay less with volume-based discounts when you use more.

Some services offer tiered pricing, so the per-unit cost is incrementally lower with increased usage.

For example, the more Amazon S3 storage space you use, the less you pay for it per GB.
