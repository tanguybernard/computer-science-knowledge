# Blockchain Ethereum 

## Blockchain definition

A blockchain is a database of transactions that is updated and shared across many computers in a network. 
Every time a new set of transactions is added, its called a “block” - hence the name blockchain.

## Transaction

There are three common types of transactions on the Ethereum network:

- An ordinary transaction, when there is a transfer of ETH/ether from one account to another.
- A transaction creating a contract is the type of transaction where a smart-contract in deployed on the Ethereum blockchain network.
- A transaction invoking a contract, this transaction is sent with some data and is used to query/interact with a previously deployed smart-contract.
